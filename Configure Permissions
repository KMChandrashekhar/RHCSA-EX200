Question:9 Configure /var/tmp/fstab permissions
Copy the file /etc/fstab to /var/tmp/fstab . Configure the permissions of /var/tmp/fstab to meet the following conditions:
File /var/tmp/fstab owned by root user
File /var/tmp/fstab belongs to group root
The file /var/tmp/fstab should not be executable by anyone.
User natasha can read and write to /var/tmp/fstab.
User harry cannot write or read /var/tmp/fstab.
All other users (current or future) can read /var/tmp/fstab.
Answer:9 Configure /var/tmp/fstab permissions
1. File copy
[root@node1 ~]# cp /etc/fstab /var/tmp/fstab

2. Check whether the owner and the owner group meet the meaning of the question, and there is no execution permission
[root@node1 ~]# ll -d /var/tmp/fstab
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 534 May 23 12:27 /var/tmp/fstab

3. Set setfacl permission
man setfacl
[root@node1 ~]# setfacl -m u:natasha:rw-,u:harry:- /var/tmp/fstab

4. Verify
[root@node1 ~]# getfacl /var/tmp/fstab
user:natasha:rw-
user:harry:---

#USER PERMISSIONS
